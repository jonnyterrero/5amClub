So let's go ahead and take a look at what does work and how we can calculate that work so let's look at 1st work due to overweight so we're. Work Due. To weight. So if we look at up a weight. Straight again. So here's our. Weight. W.. And that weight gets from home it's current location to another location say over here. Over here. And it doesn't really matter how it gets there see it follow its own strange path it went off and down and over and here and then eventually got to that location. But the only thing that involves work is the actual vertical distance of the weight travelled so. We're now talking about this delta y.. As the distance that the weight travels so if you look at the equation here in the math we've got. You to do to work is equal to the air and are all from one to 2 of the course in this case our weight dot ts. And so in our case is w. vector dot with the Delta y. vector if we do the dot product we end up with w. Delta y.. Co-signed. 180 degrees. So our work. Our work. Due to weight is going to be equal to minus w. the. Delta walk. In this equation is based on weight. And displacement. Displacement. Here and. Opposite. Directions. So the weight goes up. That displacement is up in a way that is force point down you're going to get in a negative work. So we can rate this differently and. The weight work due to work due to weight is equal to the weight. Times h one minus age 2. So work can be. Positive or negative. So a weight going downward is going to be positive work in a way going upward will be negative work. Next let's take a look at work due to friction. So let's go ahead and look at a horizontal surface here. And we're going to have. To put a box here. And this initial position in the box and it's going to end up someplace over here. We've got the weight of the box. We've got the normal force. And we've got a friction force that's going to oppose the motion and. Or box is going to displace from. And there. Too there so there's our ask or displacement. Or we could talk about the distance d. from the center man to. Call d.. And see here Mr swivel this is position one and this is the solution. So that we can say that. Our work due to the friction is equal to the integral of s. with one test or 2. Of dot d.s.. As you believe equal to 02 d.. Times f. cosigning. $180.00 degrees Dia because our friction forces are left motionless that right we're going to get native work and friction is always going to be negative. So we have work. To work due to friction that is going to be equal to minus d.. In our friction force it's moving as kinetic friction so minus the use of a and. D.. And so just no here sliding friction. Always. Does. Negative. X. Let's take a look at. Work due to a spring. Were. To. Spring. So there's are spring. Going to call this dimension here an old 0. Or were unstretched. And you. Position one. This distance. Is a sphere. And this distance. Is l.. So you can see this one is just one minus healthier. Go to position 3. This is 2. Weeks soon and are just since. 000. And this just in to say yes to. So you can see the best to simply to minus 120. In his position to. So now we can go ahead a writer for sure you. Can Say the word due to supreme sequel to your role just want him. To. Shrink house to one escape times yes. So there's your Porsche climbs to the. Cage so that just ends up the whining of. A square over to. Provide a wave from Swan. Street. So with Guy. Due to the spring worked into the spring there's equal the money issue was a. One. Day climbs to square one in this. Yes once. You go back and look we can see as I mentioned before that s one is simply going to be all was money so here I was going to give you my last one. And then. All to rush through is going to be all to my wrist feel sure. That they're in there. So. Yes one is equal to 01 minus feels Jiro. To is equal to. 0 to one. Little 0. And these are measured with. Respect to. Stretch. Where. They should with stress.
