All right let's not talk about work do to of course. Work. To. Force. So let's apply a force here where p. is equal to 5 s. squares with a variable force depending on the position. And it's at a slope. I mean. 34. And it's going to start here. Position one and go to here. Position 2 and short distance travel go from center to center one call that s. equals let's say 10. Feet. And so once again we start with our gracious and. So all our work through the p.. Is going to be equal to the inner all s one to s $20.00 f.. D. Yes. Which in this case is equal or unit wrong 0 to $10.00. 5 s. squared. And we only want the x. component of that. Sorry about the x. component. It's going to be 4. Times. D.s.. So that's equal to the Internet or all serum a 10. 4 x. squared. Or a square d. s.. Which is equal to s Q. 4 s Q 2 or 3. From 0 to 10. Which is equal to. 1333. Foot. Force Times just so for. P. was in panels. So we can write simply that. Were due to be is equal to the end of the roll. Co-signed. Data vs. War were due to a piece equal to a force cosigned they. Don't. Where this is for variable force. And this is for constant use. And if I lived were due to a couple. And so were all. One strong body here that's good in route then. So we apply a couple. To that body. It's going to. It's going to travel through some. Distance data. And let's give that couple of. Variable value so let's call it. The really. They just squared. My 4 they. Plus 4. And it's going to be apply. Through. High. Radiance. You'll note here that we're due to a couple will be plus. See the couple and they. Are same direction. And b. minus. A couple and. Opposite directions. So that we can say that. You 2 to a couple. Is equal to the general from 3 to one. Maybe 2 you. See. The thing which in our case is in a row from 0 to pottery. 3 They were squared. Minus 4 they was. 5. D.s. I'm sorry if the. Data. So we've got the you do to a couple in this case is equal to. They take you. To the square. If they. Value weighted from the 0 to a pod. Because 27. Beginner are generally equations then for you 2 to a couple were due to a couple in a row they'd of one. If they had 2. Yes. To a point against Ari. That would be for a variable and then lead to a couple Carson to simply give you a couple times they do 2 minors a one. So this is a variable. So you have to actually do the integration. In which is a constant. So that takes care of everything it does work and go home take a look at some work she practiced triangulated work and energy.
