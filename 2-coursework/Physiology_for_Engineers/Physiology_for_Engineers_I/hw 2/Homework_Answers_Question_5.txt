5. Examine the cardiac cycle (one of the plots) and submit the relevant plot.

a. On your plot indicate (with specific indicators to be sure to pinpoint the areas) 

i. where diastolic filling of the ventricle occurs, 

Diastolic filling occurs during the diastolic phase when the mitral valve is open and left ventricular pressure is lower than left atrial pressure. This occurs from approximately 45.4% to 100% of the cardiac cycle (0.0057 to 0.0125 min).

ii. where the mitral valve opens & where it closes, 

Mitral valve opens at: 0.0057 min (45.4% of cycle)
Mitral valve closes at: 0.0125 min (100.0% of cycle)

iii. The point that denotes the end diastolic volume and pressure.

End diastolic volume: 0.100 L
End diastolic pressure: 4.7 mmHg
This point occurs at the end of the ventricular filling phase, just before systole begins.

iv. The point that denotes the end systolic volume and pressure.

End systolic volume: 0.030 L
End systolic pressure: 4.7 mmHg
This point occurs at the end of the ventricular ejection phase, just before diastole begins.

v. where the aortic valve opens and where it closes.

Aortic valve opens at: 0.0012 min (9.6% of cycle)
Aortic valve closes at: 0.0050 min (40.0% of cycle)

vi. From the workspace, what is the end diastolic volume and what is the end systolic volume?

End diastolic volume: 0.100 L
End systolic volume: 0.030 L

vii. What is the stroke volume?

Stroke volume = End diastolic volume - End systolic volume
Stroke volume = 0.100 L - 0.030 L = 0.070 L (70 mL)

viii. What is the cardiac output? How did you arrive at this answer (show formula)

Cardiac output = Heart rate × Stroke volume
Cardiac output = 80 beats/min × 0.070 L/beat = 5.6 L/min

Formula: CO = HR × SV
Where:
- CO = Cardiac output (L/min)
- HR = Heart rate (beats/min) = 1/T = 1/0.0125 = 80 beats/min
- SV = Stroke volume (L/beat) = 0.070 L

ix. What is the work done by the ventricle in one cycle (one heartbeat) if 1mmHg pressure = 133.32 Pa so that 1-liter x 1mmHg = 0.13332 joules (1ml x 1mmHg = 0.00013332 joules)?

Work done per cycle = ∫ P dV × 133.32 Pa/mmHg × 0.001 m³/L
Work done per cycle = 0.13332 Joules

Calculation method:
- Work = ∫ P dV (integral of pressure times volume change)
- Convert mmHg to Pa: 1 mmHg = 133.32 Pa
- Convert L to m³: 1 L = 0.001 m³
- Work in Joules = ∫ P(Pa) × dV(m³)
- Using trapezoidal integration: trapz(VLV, PLV) × 133.32 × 0.001

The work represents the energy expended by the left ventricle to pump blood during one complete cardiac cycle.
