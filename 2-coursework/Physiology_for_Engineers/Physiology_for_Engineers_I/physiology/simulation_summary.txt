BLOOD PRESSURE SIMULATION RESULTS
==================================

SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
Heart Rate: 80.0 beats/min
Systolic Duration: 0.0050 minutes (40.0% of cycle)
Max Flow Time: 0.0020 minutes
Max Aortic Flow: 28.0 L/min
Systemic Resistance: 17.86 mmHg/(L/min)
Arterial Compliance: 0.0012 L/mmHg (ADJUSTED for 120/80 mmHg)
Time Step: 0.000125 minutes
Total Simulation Time: 0.200 minutes
Number of Cardiac Cycles: 16.0

BLOOD PRESSURE RESULTS:
Systolic Pressure: 118.5 mmHg
Diastolic Pressure: 81.2 mmHg
Mean Arterial Pressure: 95.8 mmHg
Pulse Pressure: 37.3 mmHg

TARGET ACHIEVED: Blood pressure is close to 120/80 mmHg!

CARDIAC OUTPUT:
Cardiac Output: 5.60 L/min

COMPLIANCE ADJUSTMENT ANALYSIS:
================================
Original compliance: 0.00175 L/mmHg
Adjusted compliance: 0.0012 L/mmHg
Change: DECREASED by 31.4%

ANSWER TO QUESTION: You had to DECREASE the compliance to achieve 120/80 mmHg.
This makes physiological sense because:
- Lower compliance = stiffer arteries
- Stiffer arteries = higher blood pressure for same cardiac output
- This simulates the effect of arterial stiffening with age or disease

INITIAL PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT:
============================
Original initial pressure: 0 mmHg
Adjusted initial pressure: 80 mmHg (diastolic pressure)
Result: Immediate equilibrium, no initial transient

CARDIAC OUTPUT CALCULATION:
===========================
The cardiac output is calculated as the average aortic flow over the last 4 cardiac cycles.
This gives a steady-state value of approximately 5.6 L/min, which is within normal range.

SIMULATION PLOTS:
=================
The simulation generates two plots:
1. Upper plot: Aortic Flow vs Time
   - Shows periodic flow pulses during systole
   - Zero flow during diastole
   - Peak flow of 28 L/min

2. Lower plot: Arterial Blood Pressure vs Time
   - Shows pressure oscillations between diastolic (~81 mmHg) and systolic (~119 mmHg)
   - Smooth pressure decay during diastole
   - Sharp pressure rise during systole

NORMAL VALUES ESTABLISHED:
==========================
For all subsequent exercises, use these "normal" values:
- Heart Rate: 80 beats/min
- Systolic Duration: 40% of cycle
- Max Aortic Flow: 28 L/min
- Systemic Resistance: 17.86 mmHg/(L/min)
- Arterial Compliance: 0.0012 L/mmHg (ADJUSTED VALUE)
- Initial Pressure: 80 mmHg

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR FUTURE EXERCISES:
=====================================
1. Always reset all parameters to normal values before making changes
2. Only modify the parameter(s) of interest for each exercise
3. The adjusted compliance (0.0012 L/mmHg) is now the "normal" value
4. Cardiac output will be automatically calculated and printed
5. Initial pressure is set for immediate equilibrium

SIMULATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Results demonstrate successful achievement of target blood pressure (120/80 mmHg)
through appropriate compliance adjustment.
