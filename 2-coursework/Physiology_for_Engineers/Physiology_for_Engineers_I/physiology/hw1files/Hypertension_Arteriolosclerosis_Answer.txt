QUESTION: What one parameter would you alter to best demonstrate the hypertension caused by arteriolosclerosis in our model?

ANSWER:

To best demonstrate hypertension caused by arteriolosclerosis, I would alter the **SYSTEMIC RESISTANCE (Rs)** parameter.

RATIONALE:

1. **Arteriolosclerosis Definition**: Arteriolosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of arterioles (small arteries), which increases resistance to blood flow.

2. **Physiological Mechanism**: 
   - In arteriolosclerosis, the arterioles become stiffer and narrower
   - This increases the resistance to blood flow through the systemic circulation
   - According to Ohm's law: Pressure = Flow × Resistance
   - Higher resistance leads to higher blood pressure

3. **Model Parameter**: 
   - Rs = Systemic resistance (mmHg/(L/min))
   - Current normal value: Rs = 17.86 mmHg/(L/min)
   - To simulate arteriolosclerosis: INCREASE Rs to a higher value (e.g., 25-35 mmHg/(L/min))

4. **Expected Results**:
   - Higher systolic pressure (e.g., 140-160 mmHg instead of 120 mmHg)
   - Higher diastolic pressure (e.g., 90-100 mmHg instead of 80 mmHg)
   - Same cardiac output (since heart function is unchanged)
   - Demonstrates the characteristic hypertension pattern

5. **Why NOT other parameters**:
   - Compliance (Csa): Would affect pressure differently and doesn't directly model arteriolar narrowing
   - Heart rate (T): Would change cardiac output, not just pressure
   - Stroke volume (QMAX): Would change cardiac output, not just pressure
   - Initial pressure: Would only affect starting conditions, not the underlying pathology

CONCLUSION:
Increasing the systemic resistance (Rs) from 17.86 to approximately 25-30 mmHg/(L/min) would best demonstrate the hypertension caused by arteriolosclerosis, as it directly models the increased resistance to blood flow that occurs when arterioles become hardened and narrowed.
