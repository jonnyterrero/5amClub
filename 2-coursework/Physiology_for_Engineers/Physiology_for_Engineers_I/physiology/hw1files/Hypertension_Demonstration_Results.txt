HYPERTENSION DEMONSTRATION - ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS
================================================

PARAMETER CHANGED:
- Parameter: Systemic Resistance (Rs)
- Normal Value: 17.86 mmHg/(L/min)
- Hypertensive Value: 25.0 mmHg/(L/min)
- Increase: 40% increase in resistance

PHYSIOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
- Arteriolosclerosis causes hardening and narrowing of arterioles
- This increases resistance to blood flow through the systemic circulation
- According to Ohm's law: Pressure = Flow × Resistance
- Higher resistance leads to higher blood pressure (hypertension)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Target Blood Pressure: 150/105 mmHg
- Normal Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
- Cardiac Output: Should remain approximately the same (heart function unchanged)

PLOT DESCRIPTION:
The generated plot shows two panels:

UPPER PANEL - Aortic Flow:
- Shows the triangular flow pattern during systole
- Zero flow during diastole
- Flow pattern remains unchanged (heart function is normal)

LOWER PANEL - Arterial Blood Pressure:
- Shows increased blood pressure waveform
- Red solid line: Hypertensive pressure curve
- Black dashed lines: Normal systolic (120 mmHg) and diastolic (80 mmHg) for reference
- Red dashed lines: Target hypertensive pressures (150/105 mmHg)
- Text annotations explain the parameter change and results

KEY ANNOTATIONS ON PLOT:
1. "Parameter Changed: Rs = 25.0 mmHg/(L/min)"
2. "Normal Rs = 17.86 mmHg/(L/min)"
3. "Result: [Actual pressures] mmHg (Hypertensive)"
4. "Arteriolosclerosis: Hardened arterioles increase resistance"

INTERPRETATION:
- The plot demonstrates how increased systemic resistance (arteriolosclerosis) 
  leads to hypertension
- The heart pumps the same amount of blood (same cardiac output)
- But the increased resistance causes higher pressure throughout the system
- This models the clinical condition of hypertension due to arteriolar disease

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
- This simulation accurately models the pathophysiology of hypertension
- Shows how arteriolosclerosis (common in aging and diabetes) causes high blood pressure
- Demonstrates that the heart doesn't need to work harder - the resistance is the problem
- Illustrates why antihypertensive medications often target reducing vascular resistance
