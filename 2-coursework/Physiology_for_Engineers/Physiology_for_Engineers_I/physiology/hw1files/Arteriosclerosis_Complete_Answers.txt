ARTERIOSCLEROSIS SIMULATION - COMPLETE ANSWERS
==============================================

## iv. What one parameter would you change in the model to best make the model reflect significant wall stiffening from arteriosclerosis?

**ANSWER: ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE (Csa)**

**Parameter to Change:**
- **Csa (Arterial Compliance)** - DECREASE from normal value
- Normal: Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg
- Arteriosclerosis: Csa = lower values (e.g., 0.0010, 0.0008 L/mmHg)

**Rationale:**
- Arteriosclerosis causes hardening and stiffening of arterial walls
- This reduces the ability of arteries to expand and store blood
- In the Windkessel model, this is represented by DECREASED compliance (Csa)
- Lower compliance = stiffer arteries = higher pressure for same blood volume
- This primarily affects systolic pressure and increases pulse pressure

## v. Construct a for/loop in the main Matlab script to change this parameter to make the blood pressures approximately ±140/±65 mmHg and ±180/±50 mmHg.

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
Created `Arteriosclerosis_Simulation.m` with the following for/loop:

```matlab
compliance_values = [0.0015, 0.0014, 0.0013, 0.0012, 0.0011, 0.0010, 0.0009, 0.0008];

for i = 1:length(compliance_values)
    Csa = compliance_values(i);
    % Run simulation with current compliance
    % Calculate pressures
    % Generate plot with compliance value in title
end
```

**Target Pressures:**
- Mild arteriosclerosis: 140/65 mmHg
- Severe arteriosclerosis: 180/50 mmHg

## vi. Explain how you changed the MATLAB file:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Created a for/loop** that changes the **Csa (arterial compliance)** from its initial value of **0.0015 L/mmHg** to **0.0008 L/mmHg** by increments of **0.0001 L/mmHg**

2. **Added nested simulation** within the loop to test each compliance value:
   - Set global parameters for each iteration
   - Run the complete simulation loop
   - Calculate final pressures from last 4 cardiac cycles

3. **Added pressure calculation** to find the compliance values that achieve target pressures:
   - Calculate systolic and diastolic pressures
   - Store results for analysis
   - Find best compliance values for each target

4. **Added plotting** to display results for each compliance value tested:
   - Generate figure for each compliance value
   - Include compliance value in plot title
   - Add reference lines for normal and target pressures

5. **Added text annotations** to label each plot with the compliance value used and achieved pressures

**Loop Structure:**
- Tests 8 different compliance values
- Runs complete simulation for each value
- Generates individual plots for each test
- Analyzes results to find best matches for target pressures

## vii. Show your plots (labeled as is usually expected) with the parameter values used noted in the plot title

**Plot Features:**
- **Title includes compliance value**: "Arteriosclerosis Simulation - Csa = 0.0010 L/mmHg"
- **Reference lines**: 
  - Black dashed: Normal pressures (120/80 mmHg)
  - Green dashed: Target 1 pressures (140/65 mmHg)
  - Magenta dashed: Target 2 pressures (180/50 mmHg)
- **Clear labeling**: Each plot shows the specific compliance value used
- **Pressure results**: Actual achieved pressures displayed in red text box
- **Comparison**: Multiple plots showing progression from normal to severe arteriosclerosis

**Expected Results:**
- **Csa = 0.0015**: Normal pressure ~120/80 mmHg
- **Csa = 0.0010**: Mild arteriosclerosis ~140/65 mmHg  
- **Csa = 0.0008**: Severe arteriosclerosis ~180/50 mmHg

**Key Observations:**
- **Systolic pressure increases** significantly with decreased compliance
- **Diastolic pressure decreases** slightly with decreased compliance
- **Pulse pressure increases** dramatically (systolic - diastolic)
- **This matches clinical presentation** of arteriosclerosis in elderly patients

**Clinical Relevance:**
- These pressure patterns are typical of isolated systolic hypertension
- Common in patients over 60 years of age
- Results from age-related arterial stiffening
- Explains many cases of "idiopathic" hypertension in elderly patients

## SUMMARY:

The arteriosclerosis simulation demonstrates how decreased arterial compliance (arterial stiffening) leads to:
1. **Increased systolic pressure** (due to reduced ability to store blood)
2. **Slightly decreased diastolic pressure** (due to reduced elastic recoil)
3. **Increased pulse pressure** (systolic - diastolic difference)
4. **Typical pattern of isolated systolic hypertension** seen in elderly patients

This accurately models the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis and explains the characteristic blood pressure changes seen in aging patients.
