EXERCISE 1: Blood Pressure Simulation Setup - RESULTS

=== PART A: Baseline Simulation ===
✓ Four core files copied to "Blood Pressure" directory:
  - sa.m (main simulation script)
  - in_sa.m (initialization and parameters)
  - QAo_now.m (aortic flow calculation)
  - Psa_new.m (arterial pressure calculation)

✓ Simulation runs successfully and generates plots showing:
  - Upper plot: Aortic flow vs time (triangular pattern during systole)
  - Lower plot: Arterial pressure vs time (pressure waveform)

=== PART B: Compliance Adjustment ===
✓ Adjusted systemic arterial compliance (Csa) to achieve ~120/80 mmHg

ORIGINAL VALUES:
- Csa = 0.0012 L/mmHg (original)
- Expected pressure: Higher than 120/80 mmHg

ADJUSTED VALUES:
- Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg (increased by 25%)
- Target pressure: 120/80 mmHg

ANSWER TO PART B(i):
✓ Compliance was INCREASED from 0.0012 to 0.0015 L/mmHg
Rationale: Higher compliance allows arteries to expand more, reducing pressure

ANSWER TO PART B(ii):
✓ The adjusted compliance of 0.0015 L/mmHg should be used as the normal value
for all subsequent exercises.

=== PART C: Initial Pressure Adjustment ===
✓ Initial pressure (Psa) set to 80 mmHg (diastolic pressure)
✓ This ensures immediate equilibrium and eliminates transient effects
✓ No further adjustment needed - already optimal

=== PART D: Cardiac Output Calculation ===
✓ Added cardiac output calculation to sa.m:
  - Calculates average flow over last 4 cardiac cycles
  - Displays result in L/min
  - Automatically prints for each simulation run

CODE ADDED:
```matlab
%Calculate and print cardiac output
cycles_to_use = 4;
cycle_length = round(T/dt);
start_idx = klokmax - cycles_to_use * cycle_length + 1;
cardiac_output = mean(QAo_plot(start_idx:end));
fprintf('Cardiac Output: %.2f L/min\n', cardiac_output);

%Calculate and print systolic and diastolic pressures
pressure_data = Psa_plot(start_idx:end);
systolic_pressure = max(pressure_data);
diastolic_pressure = min(pressure_data);
fprintf('Systolic Pressure: %.1f mmHg\n', systolic_pressure);
fprintf('Diastolic Pressure: %.1f mmHg\n', diastolic_pressure);
fprintf('Current Compliance (Csa): %.4f L/mmHg\n', Csa);
```

=== FINAL PARAMETERS FOR SUBSEQUENT EXERCISES ===
NORMAL VALUES (to be used as baseline):
- T = 0.0125 min (80 bpm)
- TS = 0.4*T (40% systole)
- TMAX = 0.16*T (peak flow timing)
- QMAX = 28 L/min (max aortic flow)
- Rs = 17.86 mmHg/(L/min) (systemic resistance)
- Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg (adjusted compliance - NORMAL VALUE)
- Psa = 80 mmHg (initial diastolic pressure)
- dt = 0.01*T (time step)
- klokmax = 16 cycles simulation

=== INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE EXERCISES ===
1. Always reset all parameters to the normal values listed above
2. Change ONLY the parameter(s) being tested in each exercise
3. Use Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg as the normal compliance
4. Start with Psa = 80 mmHg for immediate equilibrium
5. Cardiac output will be automatically calculated and displayed
