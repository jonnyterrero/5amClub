EXERCISE 1 - PART B: COMPLIANCE ADJUSTMENT SUMMARY
==================================================

QUESTION: Adjust the systemic arterial compliance by trial and error to achieve a blood pressure of about 120/80 mmHg.

ANSWER:

## COMPLIANCE ADJUSTMENT PERFORMED:

**Original Compliance Value:**
- Csa = 0.0012 L/mmHg (initial value)

**Adjusted Compliance Value:**
- Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg (final value)

**Change Made:**
- INCREASED compliance by 25% (from 0.0012 to 0.0015 L/mmHg)

## ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:

### i. Did you have to increase or decrease the compliance?
**ANSWER: INCREASED the compliance**

**Rationale:**
- Higher compliance allows arteries to expand more easily
- This reduces the pressure for the same blood volume
- According to the Windkessel model: P = V/C (Pressure = Volume/Compliance)
- Higher compliance = lower pressure for same volume

### ii. The adjusted arterial compliance should be considered as the normal value
**ANSWER: Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg is now the NORMAL VALUE**

**Implementation:**
- This value is set in the in_sa.m file
- All subsequent exercises should use this as the baseline
- Any further adjustments should be made from this value

### iii. Reset parameters to normal values in subsequent exercises
**NORMAL VALUES TO USE (from Exercise 1):**
- T = 0.0125 min (80 bpm)
- TS = 0.4*T (40% systole)
- TMAX = 0.16*T (peak flow timing)
- QMAX = 28 L/min (max aortic flow)
- Rs = 17.86 mmHg/(L/min) (systemic resistance)
- **Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg (adjusted compliance - NORMAL VALUE)**
- Psa = 80 mmHg (initial diastolic pressure)
- dt = 0.01*T (time step)
- klokmax = 16 cycles simulation

## PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:

**Why Compliance Had to be Increased:**
- The original compliance (0.0012) was too low for normal blood pressure
- This created a "stiff" arterial system
- Increasing compliance made the arteries more elastic
- This allowed the system to achieve normal 120/80 mmHg pressure

**Clinical Relevance:**
- This adjustment represents optimizing arterial elasticity
- The final value (0.0015) represents healthy arterial compliance
- This is the baseline for comparing pathological conditions

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:

✅ **Compliance adjusted**: 0.0012 → 0.0015 L/mmHg
✅ **Target achieved**: ~120/80 mmHg blood pressure
✅ **Normal value established**: Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg
✅ **Documentation complete**: All parameters documented
✅ **Ready for subsequent exercises**: Baseline values established

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE EXERCISES:

1. **Always start with these normal values**
2. **Change ONLY the parameter being tested**
3. **Reset all other parameters to normal values**
4. **Use Csa = 0.0015 L/mmHg as the normal compliance**
5. **Start with Psa = 80 mmHg for immediate equilibrium**

This compliance adjustment was successfully completed and the system is now calibrated for normal blood pressure conditions.
