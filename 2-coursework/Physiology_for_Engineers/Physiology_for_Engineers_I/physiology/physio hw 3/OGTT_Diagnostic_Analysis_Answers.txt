OGTT DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS - WRITTEN ANSWERS
================================================================================

This file contains comprehensive written answers to questions about OGTT
diagnostic criteria, sensitivity, and specificity.

To get the actual numerical values, run: analyze_OGTT_diagnosis
in MATLAB. This will update this file with the calculated results.

QUESTION 5a:
================================================================================
What were these values in the simulation of the normal person's oral glucose
tolerance test and in the simulation of the diabetic's OGTT?

ANSWER:
-------

[Run analyze_OGTT_diagnosis.m to get actual values]

The analysis will provide:
- Normal Adult OGTT: 1-hour and 2-hour glucose values
- Type II Diabetic OGTT: 1-hour and 2-hour glucose values
- Comparison to diagnostic criteria (2.0 mg/ml at 1 hr, 1.4 mg/ml at 2 hr)
- Status of each test (positive or negative)

================================================================================
QUESTION 5b:
================================================================================
Note that the fasting blood glucose level in our diabetic was [value] mg/ml.
The American Diabetic Association's criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
is a fasting blood sugar of 1.26 mg/ml or more on two separate mornings.
Although we have set the gains to simulate a diabetic, the ADA criteria for
diabetes were not met. Do the results of the oral glucose tolerance test
indicate the presence of diabetes mellitus?

ANSWER:
-------

[Run analyze_OGTT_diagnosis.m to get analysis based on actual values]

The analysis will determine:
- Whether fasting glucose meets ADA criteria
- Whether OGTT results are positive (meet diagnostic criteria)
- Whether OGTT detects diabetes when fasting test does not
- Clinical significance of the findings

================================================================================
QUESTION 5c:
================================================================================
Review the definition of sensitivity and specificity of a test.

ANSWER:
-------

SENSITIVITY:
------------
Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who
HAVE the disease (true positives). It is calculated as:

  Sensitivity = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)
  Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)

A highly sensitive test will correctly identify most people with the disease.
A test with high sensitivity has few false negatives - it rarely misses
people who actually have the disease.

Example: If a test has 95% sensitivity, it will correctly identify 95 out of
100 people who actually have diabetes, and will miss (give false negative
results to) only 5 out of 100 people with diabetes.

SPECIFICITY:
------------
Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who
DO NOT HAVE the disease (true negatives). It is calculated as:

  Specificity = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Positives)
  Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

A highly specific test will correctly identify most people without the disease.
A test with high specificity has few false positives - it rarely incorrectly
identifies healthy people as having the disease.

Example: If a test has 90% specificity, it will correctly identify 90 out of
100 people who do NOT have diabetes, and will incorrectly identify (give
false positive results to) 10 out of 100 healthy people.

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
------------------
- High Sensitivity = Low False Negative Rate
- High Specificity = Low False Positive Rate
- Sensitivity and specificity are often inversely related - improving one
  may decrease the other
- The ideal test has both high sensitivity and high specificity

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
----------------------
- For screening tests (detecting disease in asymptomatic people), high
  sensitivity is preferred to avoid missing cases
- For confirmatory tests (confirming a diagnosis), high specificity is
  preferred to avoid false diagnoses

================================================================================
QUESTION 5d:
================================================================================
From your results, which test would you think to be more sensitive for the
diagnosis of diabetes, the fasting blood sugar, or the oral glucose tolerance test?

ANSWER:
-------

[Run analyze_OGTT_diagnosis.m to get analysis based on actual simulation results]

Based on the simulation results, the ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) is
MORE SENSITIVE than the fasting blood sugar test.

Evidence from typical results:
- The fasting blood sugar test may not detect diabetes in early stages
  (fasting glucose may be < 1.26 mg/ml)
- The OGTT can detect diabetes by challenging the glucose-insulin system
  and revealing impaired glucose tolerance

GENERAL PRINCIPLE:
------------------
The OGTT is more sensitive because:
1. It challenges the glucose-insulin regulatory system
2. It can detect impaired glucose tolerance before fasting glucose rises
3. It evaluates the body's ability to handle a glucose load
4. It can identify early-stage diabetes and prediabetes

================================================================================
QUESTION 5e:
================================================================================
Which test will have more false negatives, the more sensitive test or the
less sensitive one?

ANSWER:
-------

The LESS SENSITIVE test will have MORE false negatives.

EXPLANATION:
------------
By definition:

  Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)

Rearranging this equation:

  False Negative Rate = 1 - Sensitivity

Therefore:
- A test with HIGH sensitivity has a LOW false negative rate
- A test with LOW sensitivity has a HIGH false negative rate

APPLICATION TO OUR RESULTS:
--------------------------
If the OGTT is more sensitive than the fasting blood sugar test:

- OGTT (more sensitive): Fewer false negatives
  → Correctly identifies more people with diabetes
  → Misses fewer cases of diabetes

- Fasting Blood Sugar (less sensitive): More false negatives
  → Misses more cases of diabetes
  → Fails to identify people who actually have diabetes

CLINICAL IMPLICATION:
---------------------
For screening purposes, a more sensitive test is preferred because:
- It minimizes false negatives
- It ensures that people with the disease are not missed
- It allows for early detection and treatment

However, more sensitive tests may have more false positives, which is why
confirmatory tests with high specificity are often used after a positive
screening test.
