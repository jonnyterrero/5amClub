# Systems Architecture

This workspace is structured as a modular, scalable, AI-readable knowledge system.  

Every folder represents a knowledge domain or engineering domain.

## High-Level Structure

- **0-docs** → Core documentation and philosophy

- **1-self-study** → Learning outside of university classes

- **2-coursework** → Notes organized by broad class categories

- **3-cheatsheets** → Quick-reference sheets grouped by category

- **4-homework** → Problem sets and solutions, matching coursework structure

- **5-engineering-projects** → Real engineering builds (apps, hardware, AI agents)

- **6-product-dev** → Brand and startup-related projects

- **7-automations** → AI agent workflows and automation systems

- **8-resources** → PDFs, textbooks, reference materials

- **9-archive** → Old material

## Design Goals

- Scalability for years of classes

- Consistent category alignment

- Easy for AI agents to index

- Easy for future me to understand

- Maintains clarity and separation of concerns
